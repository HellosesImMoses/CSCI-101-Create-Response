You've heard great things about the Joker movie
You're sure she'll love it!
---------------------------------------------------------
Once there you sell your soul to get some popcorn and drinks for the two of you
You notice she seems a little nervous, you figure it's just first date jitters
and move on to your theater
---------------------------------------------------------
Once inside the theater you notice she seems way more nervous and freaked out then before
but the movie is just about to start...
---------------------------------------------------------
Should I ask her what's wrong?
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Lean over and ask if she's feeling ok
2. Im sure she's fine, let's just enjoy the movie
