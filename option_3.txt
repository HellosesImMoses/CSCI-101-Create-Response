You decided on a coffee shop, even though you hate coffee?
You seriously can't think of anything else to do with her?
---------------------------------------------------------
Screw it, you ended up chickening out and told her you can't go out that night
and you'll have to try for some other time
---------------------------------------------------------
You have earned the 'Cold Coffee' ending!
Better luck next time!
