You lean over and ask if she's doing alright
She tells you that she's actually terrified of clowns
And didn't want to say anything to ruin the date
---------------------------------------------------------
Your heart stops
You totally forgot that she was afraid of clowns!
---------------------------------------------------------
Should you leave?
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Pfft no way! I payed for these tickets we're staying
2. You walk with her out of the theater apologizing the whole way out
