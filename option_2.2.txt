You decide to take her to the new Charlie's Angels
But as soon as she realizes what movie you chose she just walks off without a word
---------------------------------------------------------
You chase after her and ask her what's wrong
To which she tells you she can't stand that movie and refuses to 
be with someone who would actually go to see it
She then walks off in a huff leaving you alone
---------------------------------------------------------
You have earned the 'Bad Movies = Bad Dates' ending!
Better luck next time!
